ACT I

TIME: April 16th, 1387. Late afternoon.


SCENE: The Tabard Inn at Southwark, near London.


        _When the scene opens, about half of the PILGRIMS have
        arrived; the others come in during the first part of the
        act. Those already arrived are the MILLER, SHIPMAN, COOK,
        PARSON, PLOUGHMAN, FRANKLIN, DOCTOR, FRIAR, HABERDASHER,
        CARPENTER, WEAVER, DYER, TAPICER, CLERK, and CHAUCER._

        _At rise of curtain, the HOST is just moving to receive
        the KNIGHT, SQUIRE, and YEOMAN at the door, back. Chaucer
        sits with a big volume on his knee in the corner by the
        fireplace, left; right front, the Miller and the Cook are
        wrestling, while those near look on._

                                  COOK

    Now, masters, see a miller eat bran!

                                 MILLER

                                         Corpus!
    I’d liever wrastle with a butterfly.

                                SHIPMAN

    Tackle him aft.

                                FRANKLIN

                    Grip, mon.

                      [_They clutch each other._]

                             A SERVING-MAID

                          [_Aside to Friar._]

                               A diamond pin?

                                 FRIAR

                          [_Lisps slightly._]

    One of thy glances stickéd through my heart!

                        [_Offers her the pin._]

                              SERVING-MAID

    The Master is not looking now.

                                 FRIAR

                                   A bargain?

[_Maid nods, takes the pin, and hurries off to serve at table. Friar
follows._]

                                  HOST

    Welcome, Sir Knight!

                                 KNIGHT

                         Is this the Tabard Inn?

                                  HOST

         [_Points through the open door to his swinging sign._]

    Lo yonder, sir, is Herry Bailey’s shirt
    Flappeth in the wind; and this is Herry himself.

                 [_Claps his hands for a serving-boy._]

    Knave!

                                 WEAVER

        [_Pounds on the table with a jug, while Carpenter tosses
                                dice._]

           Ale, here! Ale!

                 [_A shout from the pilgrims, front._]

                                 MILLER

                         [_Throwing the Cook._]

                           Down!

                                SHIPMAN

                                 Jolly chuck!

                                  COOK

        [_Getting to his feet with a bloody nose and fisting._]

                                              ’Sblood! Thou--

                                FRANKLIN

    Hold, Master Cook, sith thou hast licked the platter,
    Go now and wash the gravy off thy nose.
    Look to him, doctor.

                                 DOCTOR

                         Here!

                                FRANKLIN

                           [_To the Miller._]

                               And thou shalt eat
    A sop of wine with me. By God, thy hand!

                                 PARSON

                  [_To Ploughman, drawing him away._]

    He sweareth like Sathanas. Come!

                               PLOUGHMAN

                                     Toot, brother!
    A little swearing saveth from the gallows.

                                 MILLER

                       [_Laughing at the Cook._]

    His nose is like a tart.

                                 CLERK

             [_To Chaucer, feasting his eyes on his book._]

                             Grant pardon, sir.
    In vanitate humanorum rerum,
    I’ the world’s uproar, ’tis sweet to find a scholar.

                                CHAUCER

    A book’s a mistress all the world may love
    And none be jilted.

                                 CLERK

                        Then am I in love.
    What is the book?

                                CHAUCER

                      A medley, like its master,
    Containing many divers characters,
    Bound in one hide. Whoso shall read it through
    He shall behold Troilus and Launcelot
    Sighing in Cæsar’s face, and Scaramouche
    Painting with grins the back of Aristotle.

                                 CLERK

                             [_Sparkling._]

    What!--Aristotle?

                                CHAUCER

                   [_Rising, hands him the volume._]

                      I prithee look it through.

                                 CLERK

    Grammercy--somewhat farther from the piping.

        [_Draws farther away from the Squire, who is beginning to
        play a few strains on his flute, in front of the fire._]

                               MAN OF LAW

                      [_Entering with_ MERCHANT.]

    For this recognisance--

                                MERCHANT

                            The ship was wrecked.

                               MAN OF LAW

    Depardieux! Then your property is flotsam
    And liable to salvage. Therefore you
    Will need me as your man-of-law.

                                 KNIGHT

                            [_To Chaucer._]

                                     I knew
    You were a soldier by your bearing, sir.
    You were at Cressy?

                                CHAUCER

                        Nay, Sir Knight, I played
    With tin swords then. Though I have often fought
    At Frenchmen’s heels, I was but six years old
    When our Black Edward won his spurs.

                                 KNIGHT

                                         Runs time
    So swiftly?--One and forty years ago!

                                  HOST

                         [_To a serving-maid._]

    Belive, wench!

                                 FRIAR

                     [_Stealing a kiss from her._]

                   In principio--

                                  HOST

                                  What’s here?

                                  MAID

    The gentle friar!

                                  HOST

                      Gentle flower-de-luce!

       [_Makes after Friar, who dodges behind_ MISTRESS BAILEY.]

                            MISTRESS BAILEY

                            [_Shrewishly._]

    Hold; goodman Herry! ’Tis a friend of mine.

                 [_Host retires; Friar mocks him._]

                                 KNIGHT

    I am returning from the Holy Land
    And go to pay my vows at Canterbury.
    This is my son.

                                CHAUCER

                    Go you to Canterbury
    As well, Sir Squire?

        [_The Squire, putting down his flute, sighs deeply._]

                                 KNIGHT

                         My son, the gentleman
    Accosts thee!

                                 SQUIRE

                  Noble gentleman--Ah me!

                           [_He turns away._]

                                CHAUCER

                            [_Follows him._]

    My dearest heart and best beloved foe,
    Why liketh you to do me all this woe?
    What have I done that grieveth you, or said,
    Save that I love and serve you, high and low?
    And whilst I live I will do ever so.
    Wherefore, my sweet, do not that I be dead;
    For good and fair and gentle as ye be,
    It were great wonder if but that ye had
    A thousand thousand servants, good and bad:
    The most unworthiest servant--I am he!

                                 SQUIRE

    Sir, by my lady’s grace, you are a poet
    And lover, like myself. We shall be brothers.
    But pardon, sir, those verses are not yours.
    Dan Chaucer wrote them. Ah, sir, know you Chaucer?

                                CHAUCER

    Twelve stone of him!

                                 SQUIRE

                         Would _I_ did! Is he not
    An amorous divinity? Looks he
    Like pale Leander, or some ancient god?

                                CHAUCER

    Sooth, he is like old Bacchus round the middle.

                                 SQUIRE

    How acts he when in love? What feathers wears he?
    Doth he sigh oft? What lady doth he serve?
    Oh!

        [_At a smile from Chaucer, he starts back and looks at him
        in awe; then hurries to the Knight. Chaucer walks among the
        pilgrims, talking with them severally._]

                                 MILLER

                            [_To Franklin._]

        Ten gallon ale? God’s arms! I take thee.

                               MAN OF LAW

                                                 What’s
    The wager?

                                FRANKLIN

               Yonder door; this miller here
    Shall break it, at a running, with his head.
    The door is oak. The stakes ten gallon ale.

                                SHIPMAN

    Ho, then, I bet the miller shall be drunk.

                                MERCHANT

    What bet?

                                SHIPMAN

              Twelve crown upon the miller.

                                MERCHANT

                                            Done.

        [_At the door appears the_ PRIORESS, _accompanied by a_ NUN

    Welcome, my lady dear. Vouchsafe to enter
    Poor Herry Bailey’s inn.

    My lady Prioress to the blue chamber
    Where His Majesty, King Richard, slept.

    Safe?

          Yes, my lady.

    Precisely! Pray proceed. I am fortunate

    And Venus rises in the house of Pisces,
    To rub it nine times with a herring’s tail.

        sore necessity for nourishment. Wherefore, being cast in
        holy pilgrimage upon this revelous inn, I appeal once
        more, gentil monsieur, to your honourable chivalry, of
        which I beseech you this favour, to wit; that you shall
        see prepared and delivered into the hands of Joannes, my
        priest, a recipe as follows:--

            One ounce of wastel-bread, toasted a pleasant brown;
            One little cup of fresh milk;
            Soak the former in the latter, till the sand-glass shall be
                run half out;
            Then sprinkle sparingly with sweet root of beet, rubbed fine.
            Serve neatly.

                                 FRIAR

    The wench? Oho! Thou sayest well. List, sir;
    List, gentle Mariner! Thy wench hath been
    A five times wedded and five hundred woo’d;
    Hath rode alone to sweet Jerusalem
    And back more oft than Dick-the-Lion’s-Heart;
    And in her right ear she is deaf as stone,
    Because, she saith, that once with her right ear
    She listened to a lusty Saracen.
    She was not born a-yesterday, yet, by
    The merry mass, when she comes in the door,
    She maketh sweet-sixteen as stale as dough.

                                SHIPMAN

    She looks a jolly Malkin. What’s her name?

    Dame Alisoun, a cloth-maker of Bath.

                                 PARSON

                             I’ll give a florin.

                                PARDONER

    Done, Master Parson. Listen, lordings, list!
    This is a piece o’ the sail St. Peter had
    When he walked on the sea; and lo! this cloth--

                                ALISOUN

    A pillow-case!

                                PARDONER

                   This is the Virgin’s veil.
    And in this crystal glass behold--

                                ALISOUN

                                       Pig’s bones!

                   [_Slaps Chaucer on the shoulder._]

    What, Geoffrey lad! Which will ye liever kiss,
    A dead saint’s bones, or a live lass--her lips?

                      [_Enter, L., the Prioress._]

                                CHAUCER

    Why, Alisoun, I say all flesh is grave-clothes,
    And lips the flowers that blossom o’er our bones;
    God planted ’em to bloom in laughter’s sunshine
    And April kissing-showers.

        [_Laughing, he kisses Alisoun and faces the Prioress._]

                               St. Charity!

                                ALISOUN

    Haha! That time I had thee on the rump.

                   [_She calls the Friar aside, R._]

                                PRIORESS

                          [_Starting to go._]

    Je vous demande pardong, Monsieur.

                                CHAUCER

                                       Madame,
    Qu’est ce que je puis faire pour elle?

                                PRIORESS

                                           Rien, rien.

                                CHAUCER

    Madame, mais si vous saviez comme je meurs
    De vous servir--

                                PRIORESS

                      You speak patois,
    Monsieur; _I_ studied French in Stratford-at-the-Bowe.

                                CHAUCER

    Your accent is adorably--unique.

                                PRIORESS

                [_Is about to melt, but sees Alisoun._]

    And you a gentilhomme--at least I thought so
    Whenas you saved my little hound--Ah, sir!

                                CHAUCER

    Adam was our first father: I’m her brother.

                                PRIORESS

    You meant no more?

                                CHAUCER

                       Her brother and your servant,
    Madame. And for the rest, I ride to Canterbury:
    I will absolve me at St. Thomas’ shrine.

                                PRIORESS

                              [_Eagerly._]

    Go you to Canterbury?

                                CHAUCER

                          With the rest.

                                PRIORESS

    Oh! I am glad--that is, I came to ask you.
    Know you, Monsieur, where lies upon the way
    A little thorp men call Bob-up-and-down?

                                CHAUCER

    Right well--we pass it on the road.

                                PRIORESS

                                        We do?
    Merci.

                                [_Going._]

                                 MILLER

                  [_Amid uproar, drinks to Alisoun._]

    Lend me thy t’other ear.

       [_Startled, the Prioress returns to Chaucer. Behind them,
        the Friar, at a sign from Alisoun, listens unobserved._]

                                PRIORESS

                             You see--
    I expect to meet my brother on the road.
    He is returning from the Holy Land;
    I am to meet him at the One Nine-pin,
    A tavern at Bob-up-and-down. But--

                                CHAUCER

                                       But?

                                PRIORESS

    I have not seen him since I was a child.
    I have forgotten how he looks.

                                CHAUCER

                                   He is
    Returning from the Holy Land?

                                PRIORESS

                                  And has
    His son with him, for squire. He is a knight.

                                CHAUCER

              [_Aside, looking at the Knight and Squire._]

    A son--his squire? Good Lord!

                                PRIORESS

                                  And so, Monsieur,
    I’m boldened by your courtesy to ask
    Your help to find him at Bob-up-and-down,
    Till which--your kind protection on the road.

                          [_More uproar, R._]

                                CHAUCER

    But--

                                PRIORESS

          Have I asked too much?

                                CHAUCER

                                 Madame, I am honoured.

                           [_Hesitatingly._]

    How, then, am I to recognise your brother?

                                PRIORESS

    He wears a ring, on which is charactered
    The letter “A,” and after, writ, in Latin,
    The same inscription as is fashioned here
    Upon my brooch. I may not take it off,
    For I did promise him to wear it always.
    But look, sir, here’s the motto. Can you read it?

      [_She extends her hand, from the bracelet of which dangles a
                   brooch. The Friar draws nearer._]

                                CHAUCER

    I thank you.

                               [_Reads._]

                 “Amor vincit omnia.”

                          [_Looking at her._]

    “Love conquers all.”

                                PRIORESS

                         C’est juste, Monsieur. Adieu!

                              [_Exit, L._]

                                 FRIAR

                       [_Making off to Alisoun._]

    Hist! “Amor vincit omnia,” Sweet Alis!

       [_After talking aside with Alisoun he goes to the Knight._]

              [_Aside, looking at the Knight and Squire._]

    A morning’s canter to Bob-up-and-down!
    “Till which--my kind protection on the road.”
    When last they met, she was a little child;
    Besides, I will make verses for his son.
    A morning’s canter--time, the month of April--
    Place, Merry England--Why not Lord Protector
    Geoffrey? Her brother! What’s a suit of armor?
    Nay! “Amor vincit omnia.”

                            [_Turns away._]

                                 FRIAR

           [_To the Knight, whose finger-ring he examines._]

                              How quaint, sir!
    A crownèd “A” and underneath a motto.

                                 KNIGHT

    Quite so.

                                 FRIAR

              Merci!

                    [_Returns quickly to Alisoun._]

                                ALISOUN

                                 FRIAR

    To-morrow.

                                ALISOUN

               Good.

                                 FRIAR

                     Sweet Alisoun--my pay?

                                ALISOUN

    Saith holy Brother Huberd? Love’s reward
    Is service.

               [_Aside, eyeing Chaucer, who passes her._]

                Corpus Venus! What a figure!
    I’ll woo him. Ay; but first to rid me of
    These other fellows.

                            [_To the Friar._]

                         Hist!
                               In Peggy’s stall--
    Peggy’s my milk-white doe--in Peggy’s stall,
    Thou’lt find another jolly beggar, waits
    To dun me.

                                 FRIAR

               Ho! A rendezvous?

                                ALISOUN

                                 A trysting.
    Go, for my love, and play the wench for me,
    And nab him by the ears until I come.

exeunt at different doors._]

                        [_Aside to the Miller._]

    And hold him till I come.

                              In Peggy’s stall?

    I thank you, sir. Is this the Tabard Inn?
    So then I’m back again. Such mighty voyages
    The mind sails in a book!

        [_He walks slowly forth into the air. Chaucer sits again by
        the fireplace, with the book on his knees._]

    Quid juris! Blood shall spurt. By quid! His nose
    Shall have a pax. By nails! A bloody quid!

        long loaf for a sword, he reels out._]

    So, Peggy, they shall woo thy lily-white hoof,
    While Alisoun doth keep her rendezvous.

    A book! Toot! My fifth husband was a clerk;
    He catched more learning _on_ his head than in it.
    What is’t about?

                     The wickedness of woman.

                                ALISOUN

    A man, then, wrote it. If you men will write,
    We wives will keep ye busy. Read’s a snack.

    Thou, too, O Cleopatra--”

                                ALISOUN

    [_Tearing a page out of the book, boxes Chaucer on the cheek._]

                              Hold thy gab!
    A devil fetch thy drasty book!

                                CHAUCER

                                   Hold, hold,
    Dame Alis! gentle Alisoun--

                      [_Recovers the torn page._]

                                ALISOUN

                                Hoot-toot!
    Are ye so dainty with a dirty parchment
    And so slipshod to smirch our reputations?
    You men! God’s arms! What ken ye of true women?
    You stuff one doll and name it Modesty,
    And bid her mince and giggle, hang her head
    And ogle in her sleeve; another poppet
    You make of snow and name St. Innocence:
    She sits by moonlight in a silver night-gown
    And sighs love-Latin in a nunnery.
    By Corpus bones! is not a mare a horse?
    A woman is but man; and both one beast--
    A lusty animal, for field or harness.
    But no! ye sanctify a squeamish mule;
    And when an honest wench, that speaks her mind,
    Meets a fine lad and slaps him on the buttock,
    And says out plat: “Thou art a man: I love thee--”
    She is a sinner, and your doll a saint.

                                CHAUCER

    Alis, thou speak’st like one in jealousy.

                                ALISOUN

    Why, Geoffrey, so I am. To tell thee flat,
    I’m jealous of thy Lady Prioress.

                                CHAUCER

    Peace, dame. Speak not her name with mine.

                                ALISOUN

                                               Aye, go it,
    Miss Innocence and Master Modesty!
    How’s that?

                                CHAUCER

                Dame Alisoun, it is enough.

                                ALISOUN

    Why, then, it is enough. Come, lad; clap hands.
    I am a bud of old experience,
    Whom frost ne’er yet hath nipped. In love, I’ve danced
    The waltz and minuet. Therefore, sweet Geoffrey,
    This Prioress wears a brooch upon her wrist.

                                CHAUCER

    Well, what of that?

                                ALISOUN

                        Yea, “What of that?” Good soul!
    She stops to-morrow at Bob-up-and-down.

                                CHAUCER

    How knowest thou?

                                ALISOUN

                      Nay, t’other ear is wise.
    At the One Nine-pin she shall meet--

                                CHAUCER

                                         Her brother.

                                ALISOUN

    What wilt thou bet she goes to meet her brother?

                                CHAUCER

    Why, anything.

                                ALISOUN

                   Hear that! As though a veil
    Were perfect warrant of virginity.
    What wilt thou bet she goeth not to meet
    Her leman--aye, her lover?

                                CHAUCER

                               Thou art daft.

                                ALISOUN

    Lo, subtle man! He robs a poor wife’s wits
    To insure his lady’s honour.

                                CHAUCER

                                 Tush, tush, dame.
    The very brooch she wears, her brother gave her,
    For whose sake she hath even promised never
    To take it off.

                                ALISOUN

    Wilt _bet_ me?

                                CHAUCER

                                   Bet away!

                                ALISOUN

    Ho, then, it is a bet, and this the stakes:
    If that my Lady Prioress shall give
    Yon brooch of gold from off her pretty wrist,
    Unto the man whom she expects to meet,
    And that same man prove not to be her brother,
    Then thou shalt marry me at Canterbury.

                                CHAUCER

    A twenty of thee, dame. But if thou lose
    The stakes, then thou shalt kneel a-down and kiss
    Yon brooch of gold upon her pretty wrist,
    And pray the saints to heal thy jealousy.

                                ALISOUN

    Aye, man, it is a bet; and here’s my fist.

                                CHAUCER

    And here’s mine, Alis; thou art a good fellow.

                         [_An uproar outside._]

    What row is this?

                                ALISOUN

                      Here comes my rendezvous.

        [_Enter in tumult, the Friar, Miller, Cook, Shipman,
        Summoner, and Manciple, holding fast to one another’s ears.
        They call out, partly in chorus._]

    He’s nabbed, sweet Alisoun.

                                 MILLER

                                Here is the lousel.

                                SUMMONER

    I’ve got his quids.

                                  COOK

                        I stalled him.

                                ALISOUN

                                       Hang fast, hold him!
    Ho! fetch him down. [_Laughing._] O Geoffrey, here’s a wooing!

                                CHAUCER

    Yea; “Amor vincit omnia.”

                             ALL THE SWAINS

                              Here he is!

                                ALISOUN

    Leave go.

                         [_They let go ears._]

              Where is the knave?

                                  ALL

                      [_Pointing at one another._]

                                  There.

                                ALISOUN

                                         Which one?

                                  ALL

                                ALISOUN

    So, so! Hath Peggy jilted all of ye,
    That took such pains to grow you asses’ ears?
    Fie! Peg’s a jade--come back to Alisoun;
    She’ll learn ye the true dance of love.

                                  ALL

                                CHAUCER

    Nay, Robin Huberd, Roger--lads, chirk up.
    These be the thorny steps of Purgatory
    That lead ye to your Beatrice of Bath.
    When ye attain unto her t’other ear--

                            [_They groan._]

                                 FRIAR

    We have attained unto it.

                                ALISOUN

                         [_Draws them aside._]

    Come here, sweethearts! Hark! I have made a bet
    With goodman Geoffrey yonder. Him as helps
    Me best to win my bet, by God! he shall
    Make merry for my marriage. Come, which fellow
    Will help me?

                                  ALL

                  I!

                     The best shall make me bride.

    Meat!

    Madame, will you vouchsafe to me the honour?

    Merci.

            [_Imitating the Prioress, takes his other arm._]

    Merci!

                                them._]

                                  HOST

    Lordings! Now hearkneth to a merry game.
    To-morrow when you canter by the way
    It is no mirth to ride dumb as a stone.
    I say--let every fellow tell a tale
    To short the time, and him as tells the best
    You’ll give a supper here when ye return.
    Lo! I myself will ride with you and judge.
    If ye assent, hold up your hands.

                                  ALL

ACT SECOND

    “Whan that Aprille with his shoures sote
    The droghte of Marche hath perced to the rote,
    And bathed every veyne in swich licour,
    Of which vertu engendred is the flour;
    Whan Zephirus eek with his swete breeth
    Inspired hath in every holt and heeth
    The tendre croppes, and the yonge sonne
    Hath in the Ram his halfe cours y-ronne,
    And smale fowles maken melodye,
    That slepen al the night with open ye,
    (So pricketh hem nature in hir corages):
    Then longen folk to goon on pilgrimages.”




ACT II

TIME: April 19th. The afternoon.

        SCENE: Garden of the One Nine-pin inn at the little hamlet
        of Bob-up-and-down, en route to Canterbury.


        _Right, the inn, with door opening into garden. Back, a
        wall about chin-high in which is a wicket gate. The wall is
        newly greened over with honeysuckle and rose-vines, which
        are just beginning to blossom. Left, an arbour of the same.
        Right front, a rough table and chair. Behind the garden
        wall runs the highway, beyond which stretches a quiet
        rolling landscape, dotted with English elms and hedgerows._

        _When the curtain rises, the scene is empty. There is no
        sound except the singing of birds, and the hum of a loom
        inside the inn. Then, away to the left, is heard a bagpipe
        playing. It draws nearer. Behind the wall, then, against
        the green background of Spring, pass, in pageant, the_
        CANTERBURY PILGRIMS _on horseback. Among the last, astride
        her ambler, rides the_ WIFE OF BATH, _telling her tale, in
        the group with_ CHAUCER _and the_ PRIORESS. _Behind her
        follow the Swains, the_ MILLER _playing the bagpipe. Last
        rides the_ REEVE.

        _Behind the scene, they are heard to stop at the inn and
        call for hostlers. The bustle of arrival, horses led
        across a stone court, laughter and abuse,--these sounds
        are sufficiently remote to add to the reigning sense of
        pleasant quietness in the garden. Through the door of the
        inn enters_ CHAUCER, _alone; in his hand, some parchments.
        He enters with an abandon of glad-heartedness, half reading
        from his parchments_.

                                CHAUCER

    “When that April with his sunny showers
    Hath from the drought of March the dreamy powers
    Awaked, and steeped the world in such sweet wine
    As doth engender blossoms of the vine;
    When merry Zephirus, with his soft breath,
    In every hedge and heath inspireth
    The tender greening shoots, and the young Sun
    Hath half his course within the Ram y-run,
    And little birds all day make melody
    That, all night long, sleep with an open ee,
    (So Nature stirs ’em with delicious rages)
    Then folk they long to go on pilgrimages--”

                                 SQUIRE

                        [_Comes from the inn._]

    Dan Chaucer! Master Chaucer!

                                CHAUCER

                                 Signorino!

                                 SQUIRE

    Sir, what a ride! Was ever such a ride
    As ours from London? Hillsides newly greened,
    Brooks splashing silver in the small, sweet grass,
    Pelt gusts of rain dark’ning the hills, and then
    Wide swallowed up in sunshine! And to feel
    My snorting jennet stamp the oozy turf
    Under my stirrup, whilst from overhead
    Sonnets shook down from every bough. Oh, sir,
    Rode Cæsar such a triumph from his wars
    When Rome’s high walls were garlanded with girls?

                                CHAUCER

    Boy, let me hug thee!

                                 SQUIRE

                          Noble sir!

                                CHAUCER

                           [_Embracing him._]

                                     A hug!
    Spring makes us youths together. On such a day
    Old age is fuddled and time’s weights run down.
    Hark!

                   [_A cuckoo sounds; they listen._]

    The meadow is the cuckoo’s clock, and strikes
    The hour at every minute; larks run up
    And ring its golden chimes against the sun.

                                 SQUIRE

    Sir, only lovers count the time in heaven.
    Are you in love, too?

    Since long?

                These forty years.

                                   Nay, is your mistress
    So old?

                                CHAUCER

            She’s still kind.

                              Kind, yet old! Nay, what’s
    Her name?

                                CHAUCER

              Hush, she will hear thee.

                                 SQUIRE

                                        Hear me?

    Mine own true mistress is sweet Out-of-doors.
    No Whitsun lassie wears so green a kirtle,
    Nor sings so clear, nor smiles with such blue eyes,
    As bonny April, winking tears away.
    Not flowers o’ silk upon an empress’ sleeve
    Can match the broidery of an English field.
    No lap of amorous lady in the land
    Welcomes her gallant, as sweet Mistress Earth
    Her lover. Let Eneas have his Dido!
    Daffydowndilly is the dame for me.

    He leads her home. “Alas! sweet husband mine,

    “Perchance that I am old?” “Nay, nay,” quoth he.
    “Ugly and old,” quoth she, “cures jealousy.”
    “It doth indeed,” quoth he. “What then?” quoth she.
    “Are ye content?” “More than content,” quoth he;
    “And will ye let me do my own sweet will
    In everything?” “In everything,” quoth he,
    “My lady and my love, do as you please.”

        [_The Miller, sitting on the wall, plays his bagpipe,
        while Alisoun dances with her Swains, each of whom is
        jealous of the rest. Chaucer and the Prioress still remain
        out of sight in the arbour. As the music grows merrier,
        the Prioress begins to click the beads of her rosary

    Begone, and do your reverences.

    “When Adam delved”--who was court-poet then?
    Adam. Who was Bob Clodhopper? Why, Adam.
    Which, then, in that close body politic
    Perked high his chin? Which doffed and ducked the knee?
    Which tanned and sweat in the lean furrow? Which
    Spat on the spade--and wore it in his crest?
    Which was the real Adam? Sly Dame Clay,
    If paradox died not in Genesis,
    Let me not fancy Richard’s laureate
    Alone’s incognito. Incognito
    Are all that pass in nature’s pilgrimage,
    For thou, with loamy masks and flesh-tint veils,
    Dost make us, in this timeless carnival,
    Thy dupes and dancers, ushering the courtier
    To kiss beneath thy glove the goose-girl’s hand,
    Or snub, behind the poor familiar rogue
    And clown, some god that hides in Momus’ mask.
    Nay, but not she--my gentle Prioress!
    Though all the rest, in born disguisements, be
    Basted and togg’d with huge discrepancy,
    _She_ wears the proper habit of her soul.
    Dear God! how harmony like hers unchains
    Delight from the lugg’d body of Desire
    To sing toward heaven like the meadow-lark,
    Till, with her parting, it drops dumb again
    In the old quag of flesh.
                              Flesh, Geoffrey! Fie!
    What need to guard from sight the poet in thee
    When nature thus hath hoop’d and wadded him
    With barracoons of paunch? What say, thou tun?
    Will Eglantine mistake thee for Apollo,
    Thou jewel in the bloated toad; thou bagpipe
    Puff’d by the Muse; thou demijohn of nectar;
    Thou grape of Hebe, over-ripe with rhyme;
    Thou lump of Clio, mountain of Terpsichore;
    Diogenes, that talkest in thy tub!
    Fie, Mother Earth!--Cling not about my waist
    As if I were a weanling sphere. Fall off!
    Ye gods! that kneaded this incongruous dough
    With lyric leaven, sweat me to a rake-handle
    Or let the Muse grow fat!

                                 Dame, I have been
    A bishop’s valet, a nun’s confidant,
    A wife’s confessor, a maid’s notary;
    As coroner, I’ve sat in Cheapside inns
    When more than wine flowed. This breast can be dark
    As Pharaoh’s chamber in the pyramids.

    You mean--Dan Roderigo.

                            Aye; but as
    She hath not seen him since she was a child,
    She hath not recognised him. He, ye ken,
    Doth wear a ring wi’ a Latin posy in’t.

                                 FRIAR

    I know; ’tis “Amor vincit omnia,”
    The same as on her brooch.

                               There hangs my bet.
    For if Dame Eglantine shall give yon brooch
    Into the hands of any but her brother,
    Then Geoffrey marries me at Canterbury.

                            What then, dear friend?
    Wouldst thou forswear thy celibate sweet vows
    To buckle on a wife?

                                 FRIAR

                         Nay, dame, a sister.

                                ALISOUN

    A sister of St. Venus’ house? Go pray!
    A husband is my holy pilgrimage,
    And Geoffrey is my shrine.

                                       “Et donc?”
    Why, then, I’ll give a farthing to the friars.

                                 FRIAR

    Nay, dame, the coin of Cupid is a kiss.

                             [_Pleading._]

                                ALISOUN

                          Baiser. Baiser means
    In Latin tongue a blessing. Not so, Huberd?

                                 FRIAR

    Dame, from thy lips, it meaneth Paradise.

                                 MILLER

                           [_Imitating him._]

    Doth it in thooth, thweet thir?--Thou lisping jay!
    Thou lousy petticoats!

                                ALISOUN

          [_Suddenly embracing the Miller; whispers to him._]

                           Whist! Robin, thou
    Art just in the nick. I have a plan. Run fast;
    Fetch here the other lads, and bring a gag.

                                 MILLER

    A gag? For him?

                                ALISOUN

                    Run quick.

                                 MILLER

                               [_Going._]

                               By Corpus arms!

                                 FRIAR

                             [_Taunting._]

                       Mealy miller, moth-miller,
                               Fly away!
                  If Dame Butterfly doth say thee nay,
                      Go and court a caterpillar!

                                 MILLER

                     [_Laughing, shakes his fist._]

    Ha, ha! By Corpus bones!

                           [_Exit at gate._]

                                ALISOUN

                             Now, bird; the plot.
    I’ve sent him for a gag.

                                 FRIAR

                             A gag? What for?

                                ALISOUN

    To win my bet, of course. ’Tis for this knight.

                                 FRIAR

    Thou wilt not gag a knight--the Prioress’
    Brother!

                                ALISOUN

             Hast thou forgot I bet with Geoffrey
    The man that wears the ring will prove to be
    Dame Virtue’s lover?

                                 FRIAR

                         He that wears the ring?
    Methinks I smell: but who’s your man?

                                ALISOUN

                                          Sweet owl,
    The sunlight hurts thine eyes, thou starest too hard.

     [_Blindfolding his eyes with her hands, she whirls him thrice
                                round._]

    Behold him.

                                 FRIAR

                              [_Dizzily._]

                Where?

                  [_Alisoun slaps her own shoulder._]

                       What, thou? O ecce homo!
    Thou wilt enact the lover and the knight
    And woo Dame Eglantine?

                                ALISOUN

                            Who else? Forsooth,
    I am a shapely crusader. This leg
    Hath strode a palfrey thrice to Palestine.
    I’ve won my spurs.

                                 FRIAR

                       Thou wit of Aristotle.
    O Helen of Troy! O Amazon! I catch:
    Thou gaggest the _real_ knight and bear’st him off
    Where thou mayst steal his ring and togs.

                                ALISOUN

                                              And borrow
    A false beard from thy tippet. Thou shalt be
    My valet, and retouch the Wife of Bath
    To play the Devil in the Mystery.

                                 FRIAR

    But where’ll be thy boudoir?

                                ALISOUN

                                 The cellar yonder.
    Bob Miller and the other lads shall gag
    And tie him there.

                                 FRIAR

                       Why, this is merrier than
    Nine wenches ducking in a Hallow-een bowl.

        [_Doubling over with laughter, he almost knocks against
                Chaucer, who enters, left, meditative._]

    Whist! Geoffrey! Come away.

                                CHAUCER

                      [_Reads from a parchment._]

                              “April, May,
                              Cannot stay;
                      We be pilgrims--so are they,
                            And our shrine,
                              Far away--”

        [_A bell sounds outside; Chaucer pauses, and draws out a
                           pocket sun-dial._]

                                The chapel bell!
    Four, by my cylinder. My signorino
    Will claim his verses!

                             [_Reads on._]

                    “And our shrine,
                     Far away,
            Is the heart of Eglantine.”

                         [_Pauses and writes._]

                                ALISOUN

                          [_Aside to Friar._]

                           Eglantine! What’s this?

                                 FRIAR

    Love verses. He hath writ them for the Squire
    To give unto his lady-love Johanna.

                                ALISOUN

    But he said “Eglantine.”

                                 FRIAR

                             Aye, dame; he dubs
    Her Eglantine to be poetical.

                                ALISOUN

    A poet! Him?

                                 FRIAR

                 Why not? Jack Straw himself
    Could ring a rhyme, God wot, till his neck was wrung.

                                CHAUCER

                               [_Reads._]

                  “Eglantine,
                        O to be
                    There with thee,
                        Over sea,
                  In olive-shaded Italy.”

    Too rough. “Shaded” is harsh. H’m! “Olive-silvered.”
    “In olive-silvered Italy.”--That’s better.

                                 FRIAR

                            [_To Alisoun._]

    Hide there!

                                ALISOUN

                What now?

                                 FRIAR

                          Watch.

             [_The Friar approaches Chaucer obsequiously._]

                                CHAUCER

                             “There to pray
                            At thy shrine--”

                                 FRIAR

                                 Benedicite!
    The blissful martyr save you, sir.

                                CHAUCER

                                       And you.

                                 FRIAR

    The gentle Squire sent me for--

                                CHAUCER

    His verses? They are just finished.

                           [_Folds them up._]

                                 FRIAR

                            Sir, you see, he hailed me
    Passing upon the road. He lies out yonder
    Along a brookside, sighing for his lady.

                                CHAUCER

                [_Handing the parchment to the Friar._]

    Bid him despatch her these. Here, wait; this spray
    Of eglantine goes with them.

                                 FRIAR

                                 Save you, sir.

        [_The Friar starts for the wicket gate. Chaucer,
        absent-minded, passes on to the inn door. As he does so,
        the Friar, treading tip-toe behind him, steals another
        parchment, which is sticking from his pouch._]

                                CHAUCER

                              “April, May,
                              Cannot stay;
                     We be pilgrims--so are they.”

                               [_Exit._]

                                 FRIAR

     [_Stands holding the second parchment, from which he reads._]

        “There was also a nun, a prioress,
        That of her smiling was full simple and coy;
        The greatest oath she swore--”

                                       Blessed be larceny!
    This rhyme is slicker to have up my sleeve
    Than five aces of trumps.

                                ALISOUN

                            [_Joining him._]

                              What’s up?

                                 FRIAR

                                         List, dame!
    Of human hearts I am an alchemist.
    To stir them in the crucible of love
    Is all my research and experiment;
    And but to find a new amalgam makes
    My mouth to water like a dilettante’s.

                                ALISOUN

    Well?

                                 FRIAR

    Geoffrey wrote these verses for the Squire
    To give his lady; therefore, _I_ will give them
    To Eglantine, and watch the _tertium quid_;
    That is to say, whether the resultant be
    A mantling _coleur rose_, or--an explosion.

                                ALISOUN

    What’s in the verses? Nay, man, read ’em out;
    I am no clerk.

                                 FRIAR

    _I_ am a master-reader.

                          “Sigh, Spring, sigh,
                                 Repine
                    Amid the moon-kissed eglantine,
                             For so do I.”

                          [_The Friar sighs._]

                                ALISOUN

    No more o’ that.

                                 FRIAR

                     Sweet Alis, ’tis the art.
    When I look thus,--’tis moonlight. When I sigh
    Thus,--’tis a zephyr wooing apple blossoms.

                                ALISOUN

    Wooing a sick goat! Read ahead.

                                 FRIAR

                                    Ahem!

                               [_Reads._]

                              “April, May,
                               Cannot--”

[_Enter, from the inn, the Knight; from the wicket gate, the Swains,
with ropes and a gag._]

                                ALISOUN

    Quit; here’s our knight. Go find the Prioress.
    And when you’ve given her the verses, join
    Me and the other fellows in the cellar.

                  [_Jerking her thumb at the Knight._]

    _He_’ll be with us.

                                 FRIAR

                        Thy valet comprehends.

                                 KNIGHT

                             [_To Friar._]

    Good fellow, have you seen my son, the Squire?

                                 FRIAR

    My lord, that dame can tell you.

                    [_Throwing a kiss to Alisoun._]

                                     Au revoir!

   [_Then throwing another to the Miller, he sings as he skips out._]

                           Ma douce gazelle,
                           Ma gazelle belle,
                               Bon soir!

                          [_To the Shipman._]

    Quick! Head him off, Jack!

                        [_Exit Friar into inn._]

                                ALISOUN

                               Let him go.

                           [_To the Miller._]

                                           Thine ear!

                                 MILLER

    But--

                                ALISOUN

          Shh!

                   [_Draws him aside and whispers._]

               Art thou afeard?

                                 MILLER

                                Nay, dame, but ’tis
    A lord. Mayhap we’d catch the whipping-post.

                                ALISOUN

    But mayhap me along with it, sweet Bob.

                        [_They whisper aside._]

                                 KNIGHT

    This woman tell me of my son! ’Tis strange.

                                ALISOUN

                          [_Aside to Miller._]

    Ye ken!

                                 MILLER

            Aye, aye.

        [_Looking pleased, he speaks to the others aside. During
        the following scene, all of them approach the Knight
        cautiously with the ropes and gag, while Alisoun,
        distracting the Knight, warns or urges them in pantomime._]

                                 KNIGHT

                      Good woman, have you seen--

                                ALISOUN

    And do mine eyes behold him once again?
    O sir! The blissful saints requite you, sir!

                                 KNIGHT

    For what, good dame?

                                ALISOUN

                         His voice! That I should hear
    His voice once more! The vision bursts again
    Upon my brain: the swords, the sweated horse,
    The lifted battle-mace, and then his arms,
    His arms around me--saved!

                        [_Falling at his feet._]

                               Oh, can it be?

                                 KNIGHT

    Madame, arise. We met last night, methinks,
    At Master Bailey’s inn, in Southwark, but
    Never before.

                                ALISOUN

                              [_Rising._]

                  Hold! Gallop not so fast,
    Ye steeds of Memory!--Was it perchance
    A lonely damsel by the Coal Black Sea,
    Forsaken save by him; or was it by
    The walls of old Granada, at the siege,
    When, dazzled by the white star of my beauty,
    He raised his cross to smite the lustful Moor,
    And cried, “Don Roderigo dies for thee!”

                                 KNIGHT

                           [_To the Miller._]

    The woman is ill. You had best call a leach.

                                ALISOUN

    Call no one, sir. Forgive my sentiment.
    Small wonder is it, though the lordly falcon
    Forget the dove he succoured from the crows.
    But ah! how can the tender dove conceal
    The flutterings of her snow-white breast to meet
    Her lord once more?

                                 KNIGHT

                               [_Going._]

                        Madame, I wish you better.

                                ALISOUN

    Dear lord, when last we met at Algezir--

                                 KNIGHT

    Pray to the Virgin!

                                ALISOUN

                        Sweet lord!--

                                 KNIGHT

                                      By St. George,
    I know you not.

                                ALISOUN

                    Alas! Alas! The faithless!
    Was this the chivalry ye promised me
    That night ye kissed me by the soldan’s tent?

                                 KNIGHT

    Off me, thou wife of Satan!

                                ALISOUN

                                Heard ye that?
    Lads, to the rescue!

                                 KNIGHT

                         Sorcery!

       [_The Miller and Alisoun gag the Knight, while the others
                        assist in binding him._]

                                ALISOUN

                                  Quick, Roger!
    Take off his finger-ring. Mum, sweethearts! In, now!

       [_Exeunt omnes, carrying the Knight into the inn cellar._]

        [_Enter the Squire and Johanna. Passing along behind the
        wall, they enter the garden by the wicket gate._]

                                 SQUIRE

    Lady, I cannot yet believe my eyes
    That you are here, and not in Padua.

                                JOHANNA

    ’Tis sweet to hear your voice discredit mine,
    And yet I pray you, sir, believe in me;
    I would not prove a rich Lombardian dream
    To be more fair--even than I am.

                                 SQUIRE

                                     You could not.

                                JOHANNA

    Grazie!

                                 SQUIRE

            For you authenticise yourself
    With beauty’s passport. This alone is you;
    But how come hither?

                                JOHANNA

                         Like the Spring, because
    I heard the snows had thawed in Merry England.

                                 SQUIRE

    As ever, you’re fellow-travellers, dear lady;
    I might have guessed it from the little birds,
    Your gossipy outriders. But with what
    Less winged chaperones came you?

                                JOHANNA

                                     Nay, with none!
    Some flighty ladies of King Richard’s court
    That oped their beaks--but not like nightingales--
    To prate of love. For my part when I saw them
    This morning trot away toward Canterbury
    With that dull Gaunt and silly Duke of Ireland,
    I sighed “sweet riddance.” True, the king is different,
    But he is married.

                                 SQUIRE

                       You are not alone?

                                JOHANNA

    No, sir. I travel with a world-stormed priest,
    Whom all who love him call “Good Master Wycliffe”;
    And those who love him not, “Old Nick,” for writing
    The gospels in dear English.

                                 SQUIRE

                                 You--a Lollard!

                                JOHANNA

    Wait till you know him. He rides now to assist
    High mass at the Cathedral, for Duke John
    Who sails to claim his kingdom in Castile.
    But I ride with him, not so much to absolve
    My sins,--which frankly, since they are so few
    And serviceable, I hate to part with--as
    I go to look on one shall grace that service--
    The man I best admire.

                           Sweet lady, whom?

                                JOHANNA

    Dan Chaucer--laureate of chivalry.

                                 SQUIRE

    Chaucer! Why he--

                          [_Checks himself._]

                      Alas!

                                JOHANNA

                            Scarce do I wonder
    To see you bite your lip at that great name:
    You, sir, who once, unless my memory fail,
    Did promise me some verses of your own.

                                 SQUIRE

    Nay, you shall have them.

                                JOHANNA

                              What? The verses?

                                 SQUIRE

                                                Yes.

                                JOHANNA

    Prithee, what are they? Rondeaux, amoretti,
    Ballads? Why did you send them not? Odes? Sonnets?
    Which?

                                 SQUIRE

           Nay, I know not.

                            Know not?

                                      Not as yet.

                                JOHANNA

    Know not as yet!

                                 SQUIRE

                     I mean--O Donna mine!
    I have a friend, whom but to call my friend
    Sets all my thoughts on fire, and makes the world
    A pent-up secret burning to be told.
    Whose slave to be, I would roll Sisyphus’ stone;
    Whom to clasp hands withal, I’d fight Apollyon;
    For whom but to be Pythias, I would die.

                                JOHANNA

    What amorous Platonics! Pythias?
    Sure, Troilus were an apter choice. Well, sir,
    Who is this paragon?

                               [_Aside._]

                         Heaven send her freckles.

                                 SQUIRE

    Nay, if it were allowed me but to name--
    If you could guess the Olympian pedigree--

                    [_Enter Chaucer from the inn._]

    Ah! Here he comes!

                        [_Scanning the ground._]

    I would not for good twenty pound have lost it.

                                JOHANNA

    Is this your Damon?

                                 SQUIRE

                        Lady, ’tis my friend.

                            [_To himself._]

    If Madame Eglantine should find it, read it!
    Nay, not for forty pound.

    May I present him?

                    [_Nods carelessly, then aside._]

                       Saints! Must I essay
    To circumvent a rival of such scope?

                                 SQUIRE

    Great sir!

                                JOHANNA

               “Great sir” ’s a proper epithet.

                Ah, boy, well met! Did I perchance--

                          [_Seeing Johanna._]

    Pardon!

                               A nameless knight?

                            [_To Chaucer._]

    We saw you searching. Was it for a sur-name?

    Have you lost something? Let us help you find it.
    A purse?

                                JOHANNA

             I trust your loss was not in pounds.

                                CHAUCER

    Sooth, I have lost what fair your ladyship
    Could least, methinks, supply--a piece of wit
    Without a tongue; that is, a piece of parchment
    Writ o’er with verses.

                                 SQUIRE

                           Verses! Sir, a word.

                                JOHANNA

    A clever rogue! He’d make an apt court-fool.

                          [_Aside to Squire._]

    No; these lost verses were a mere description--
    To fit my prologue--of a dainty nun,
    Poking some gentle mirth at her; of use
    To none save me; but faith! I grudge ’em dearly.

                                 SQUIRE

    Did you find time to write--the other verses?

                               [_Aside._]

    Still whispering? Faith! Hath my Aubrey lost
    Both heart and manners to this tavern rhymester?
    I will not have it.

                                CHAUCER

    He took your mistress’s verses, saying you
    Had sent for them by him.

                                JOHANNA

                              Excuse me, sirs:
    That arbour-seat has room for two to sit,
    Providing we choose wisely from us three.

    Your choice is fate.

             [_Aside to Chaucer as they enter the arbour._]

                         The friar must have stolen them.

       [_Johanna and the Squire sit; Chaucer stands talking with
             them, his back toward the arbour’s entrance._]

      [_Enter, right, from inn, the Prioress and Friar, the former

                                PRIORESS

    The verse is very beautiful.

                                 FRIAR

                                 Is’t not
    Enough to make the Muse weep amber? Zipp!
    ’Tis honey’d moonbeams stored in lachrymals.

                                PRIORESS

                         Dame, ’tis poetry.
    In poetry, all ladies have blue eyes
    And live in Italy.

                                PRIORESS

                       And is this truly
    For me?

                                 FRIAR

            He bade me give it with this spray.

                         Then wouldst thou say:
                             ‘Pilgrim sweet
                               In Padua,
                        Take it; it is thine.’”

    Is Padua short for Bob-up-and-down?

                                 FRIAR

    Yes, dame.

                               [_Aside._]

               And now to watch my experiment
    Precipitate rose-colour.

                             Almost finished!

                                 FRIAR

    Alas, Madame, I did but do my duty.
    He bade me bring them.

                                PRIORESS

                           From my heart, I thank you.
    They’re very beautiful.

                                 FRIAR

                            But amorous,
    I fear; they are _love_-verses.

                                PRIORESS

                                  Are they? Sure,
    I thought them sweet. He is so chivalrous.

                                 FRIAR

[_Aside, takes out his stolen parchment._]

    Soft, then, I’ll try the other. This should bring
    The explosion.

         [_Eagerly, laying the first parchment on the table._]

                   Did he send more verses?

                                            Nay,
    He sent no more, though from his pouch there fell
    This parchment; but methinks he would desire you
    Not to peruse it.

     [_Turning as if to leave, he discovers the three conversing in
                             the arbour._]

    Describes you.

                                PRIORESS

                   How?

                                 FRIAR

                        Alas! In different vein
    From the other.

                                PRIORESS

                    Different?

ACT III

TIME: Evening of the same day.


SCENE: The hall of the One Nine-pin.

        _At the opening of the act all the Pilgrims are on the
        stage, except the following_: MILLER, SHIPMAN, COOK,
        MANCIPLE, SUMMONER, KNIGHT, ALISOUN, CHAUCER, _and_
        WYCLIFFE.

        _Owing to the overcrowding of the little inn, the hall is
        arranged, for the night, as a common sleeping-room. Up
        stage, right, is a great canopied bedstead, with steps to
        climb into it. Along the right wall are truckle-beds. As
        the curtain rises, a clear bell is heard ringing outside,
        slow and musical. By the light of a single torch, the
        Pilgrims are seen, some putting on their cloaks and hoods,
        some peering from behind the bed-curtains, others taking
        links from a tap-boy, who distributes them. These, as they
        are lit, throw an ever stronger light upon the grouped
        faces and contrasted garbs of the company. The PARSON is
        just waking the PLOUGHMAN, who drowses on a truckle-bed._

                         Sixpence, sir, three farthings.

        [_Dick then goes to the cellar door. As he opens it, he
        is grabbed within by the Miller, handed breathlessly to
        the Shipman, who claps his hands over the boy’s mouth, and
        disappears with him below. The door then is closed, but at
        intervals it opens and the Miller’s head is seen cautiously
        to emerge._]

    This Wycliffe’s gab hath hurt good trade. ’Twas him,

    March up to London-town with Wat the Tyler,

    Sst! Sst! Good masters! Pray, sweet lordings, here
    Comes Master Wycliffe.

        [_Enter, in conversation, WYCLIFFE and CHAUCER, followed
        by JOHANNA, who seeks to draw WYCLIFFE away. The Pilgrims
        greet the last, some with shouts of welcome, others with
        hisses._]

                                WYCLIFFE

                            [_To Chaucer._]

                           Certes, sir, it may
    Be as you say.--Good folk! good children!--Yet
    To me this England is a gorgeous tabard,
    Blazon’d with shining arms and kingly shields;
    A cloth of gold, blood-dyed with heraldries
    Of knightly joustings, presbyterial pomps,
    And red-wine revellings; cunningly, i’ the fringe,
    Chaced round with little lutes and ladies’ Cupids
    To snuggle the horse-hair lining. This brave shirt,
    This inward-goading cloth of gaiety,
    The poor, starved peasant wears on his bare back--
    A ghost, that plays the bridegroom with’s despair.

                    [_Amongst sneers and applause._]

    Right!

                            [_To Chaucer._]

           Friend, how seems it thee?

                                CHAUCER

                                      Sir, with your pardon,
    To me, our England is still “Merry England!”
    Which nature cirqued with its green wall of seas
    To be her home and hearth-stone; where no slave,
    Though e’er he crept in her lap, was nursed of her;
    But the least peasant, bow’d in lonely fief,
    Might claim his free share in her dower of grace;
    The hush, pied daisy for’s society,
    The o’erbubbling birds for mirth, the silly sheep
    For innocence.--Mirth, friendship, innocence:
    Where nature grants these three, what’s left for envy?
    These three, sir, serve for my theology.

                              MAN-OF-LAW

    Parfoi! What is this man--a Papist? Is’t
    Some courtier?

                                FRANKLIN

                   Naw! He rings true Lollard, him.
    They’re friends.

               [_Aside, to Johanna, indicating Chaucer._]

    Not speak with him?

                                JOHANNA

    A light, I am the devil, and your feet

                                               Soft!
    I’ll sprinkle a pinch of this sal volatile
    I’ the candle flame.

                           [_Lights candle._]

                         I’ll take my crucifix.

        [_He is about to go toward the priedieu, when the Friar
        thrusts his hand over the candle flame. A vivid flash of
        light reveals his black face to Bottlejohn._]

          Silence!

    [_On the hearth the Friar lights a dull red flame, which throws
                  a flickering glow about the room._]

                            [_To Alisoun._]

                   O! what art thou? Dost thou laugh?
    What is thy name?

                                ALISOUN

                     My name is Lucifer.
    These be my urchins, Belial and Moloch.
    Salaam! Salaam!

                              [_To Host._]

    What thing art thou?--Duck!

                               BOTTLEJOHN

            [_Ducks as the Miller pricks him with a dirk._]

                                I be Bottlejohn,
    The host o’ the One Nine-pin.

                                ALISOUN

                                  Bottlejohn,
    Thee and thy One Nine-pin I damn. For know,
    Thy cellar is the attic over hell,
    And hath been leaking bad ale through my ceiling
    This seven year, and made a puddle deep
    As Proserpina’s garter in her bridal
    Chamber, where thy two knaves--

                               BOTTLEJOHN

                                     What! Ned and Dick?

                                ALISOUN

    Came plumping through head-downwards into hell
    Like bullfrogs in a tarn.

                              And drowned! and drowned!
    Shalt _thou_ in thine own ale.

                      [_Leads him toward cellar._]

                                   O Virgin!

                                 FRIAR

    One comes.

                               BOTTLEJOHN

               Help! help!

                                ALISOUN

                             [_To Miller._]

                           Quick, Belial, lug thine ass
    Into his stall. Instruct him with thy whittle
    What manner devils we are, and when I clap
    My hands thus and cry “Host!” then lead him forth.

        [_Exeunt Miller and Bottlejohn into cellar. To Friar._]

    Meantime, my pixy, hide we here.

                                 FRIAR

                                     Sweet lord--

         [_They hide in the cupboard. Enter, left, Chaucer and

                                PRIORESS

                                            Parlez toujours, Monsieur!
    Parlez toujours!

                                CHAUCER

                     How silver falls the night!
    The hills lie down like sheep; the young frog flutes;
    The yellow-ammer, from his coppice, pipes
    Drowsy rehearsals of his matin-song;
    The latest swallow dips behind the stack.
    What beauty dreams in silence! The white stars,
    Like folded daisies in a summer field,
    Sleep in their dew, and by yon primrose gap
    In darkness’ hedge, St. Ruth hath dropped her sickle.

                                PRIORESS

    Nay, yonder’s the new moon.

                                CHAUCER

                                But here’s St. Ruth,
    Whose pity hath reprieved a vintner’s son.
    Your nephew’s verses--

                                PRIORESS

                           Pray speak not of them;
    That wicked Friar Huberd was to blame.
    But now--

                      [_Turning to the casement._]

              The moon, Monsieur; parlez, Monsieur!

                                CHAUCER

                               [_Aside._]

    “Parlez, Monsieur.” How shall I trust myself?

                               [_Aloud._]

    I may not, dear Madame. If I should speak,
    My heart would run in passages too sweet
    For this cloy’d planet.

                                PRIORESS

               [_Pointing through casement to the sky._]

                            Mais--parlez, Monsieur.

                                CHAUCER

    Yea, if perchance there were some _other_ star--

                                PRIORESS

    Some other star--

                                CHAUCER

                      Some star unsurfeited,
    Some blessed star, where hot and lyric youth
    Pours not swift torment in the veins of age;
    Where Passion--gorgeous cenobite--blurs not
    With fumid incense of his own hot breath
    The hallow’d eyes of sweet Philosophy;
    Where body battens not upon the soul,
    But both are Reason’s angels, and Love’s self--
    Pontifical in daisy-chains--doth hold
    High mass at nature’s May-pole;--if such star
    There were in all God’s heaven, and such indeed
    Were ours, there would I speak and utter, not
    “Dear Eglantine, I love you,” but “We love.”

                                PRIORESS

    Monsieur, ’tis true.

                         The simple truth, once said,
    Is very sweet, Madame.

                           Merci, Monsieur.

                                ALISOUN

    Whist, Huberd; are they gone?

                                 FRIAR

                                  Nay.

                          Art jealous, dame?

                                             Shut up!

                           [_At the window._]

    Some other star! Choose, lady, which is ours?

                                PRIORESS

    Yonder cool star that hides its winking light
    Like a maid that weeps--but not for heaviness.

                                CHAUCER

    Ha! If I were Prometheus now, I’d filch it
    From out the seventh crystal sphere for you
    And ’close it in this locket.

                          [_Seizes her hand._]

                                PRIORESS

                                  Nay, that holds
    My brother’s hair.

                                CHAUCER

           [_Dropping her hand, looks away into the night._]

                       We dream.

                                PRIORESS

                                 Of what, Monsieur?

                                CHAUCER

    We dream that we are back in Eden garden
    And that the gates are shut--and sin outside.

                                PRIORESS

    Why, such in truth is love.

                                CHAUCER

                                Yes, such in truth
    But not in fact, dear lady. Such sweet truth
    Grows only on God’s tree; we may behold
    And crave immortally, but may not pluck it
    Without the angel’s scourge.--“When Adam delved”--
    Aye, then he dragged both heaven and earth and hell
    Along with him.--O God! this suzerain mansion
    Where saints and crown’d philosophers discourse
    Familiarly together as thy guests--
    This ample palace of poesie, the mind--
    Hath trap-doors sunk into a murky vault,
    Where passion’s serfs lie sprawling.

                                PRIORESS

                                         I am afraid!

                                CHAUCER

    Forgive me, O sweet lady! I seem not
    All that I am.

                              [_Timidly._]

                   What are you?

                                CHAUCER

                                 Do you ask?
    Why, then, for this dull, English bulk, ’tis true
    A London vintner gat it; but for this
    My moving soul, I do believe it is
    Some changeling sprite, the bastard of a god,
    Sprung from Pan’s loins and white Diana’s side,
    That, like a fawn, I fain must laugh and love
    Where the sap runs; yet, like an anchorite,
    Pore on the viewless beauty of a book:
    Not more enamoured (when the sun is out)
    O’ the convent rose, than of the hoyden milkweed
    Bold in my path. Life, in whatever cup,
    To me is a love-potion. In one breath,
    My heart hath pealed the chimes above St. Paul’s
    And rung an ale-wife’s laughter.

    And waistband! Heard ye that?

                                  To hear you speak
    Is sweeter than the psalter. Do not stop.

    But “Eglantine” was all symphonious.
    “Johanna”--ha?--was not mellifluous

    O sky! thy noon was a broad, glorious mirror,

                           Good Aubrey, strike a light.

                                CHAUCER

    Isold and Helen, veil your starlit eyes--
    _Johanna_ comes, that doth you jeopardise!

           [_The Squire lights a candle, revealing Chaucer._]

                                JOHANNA

    O monster! It is he.

        [_Chaucer takes the candle from the Squire’s hand, and,
        holding it high, approaches Johanna, thereby throwing the
        Prioress into his own shadow._]

                                 SQUIRE

                         Nay, gentle sir!

                                CHAUCER

    Laodamia, Hero, and Dido,
    And Phyllis, dying for thy Demophon,
    And Canace, betroth’d of Cambalo,--
    Polixena, that made for love such moan,
    Let envy gnaw your beauties to the bone;
    Yea, Hypermnestra, swoon in envious sighs--
    _Johanna_ comes, that doth you jeopardise!

                                JOHANNA

    Oh, thank you--both. Squire, I congratulate
    Your cunning chivalry on luring me
    From church to bait me in this bear-trap.

                                 SQUIRE

                                              Lady,
    Upon my honour--

                            [_To Chaucer._]

                     Good sir--

                            [_To Johanna._]

                                Nay, fear nothing.
    Indeed, if you but knew--

                                JOHANNA

                    [_Catching sight of Prioress._]

                              If I but knew!
    St. Ann! I know too much.

                                 SQUIRE

                              You would be proud
    To have him rhyme your name. Sir, I protest
    Had I conceived how fair “Johanna” sounds
    In verse--

                                CHAUCER

                              [_Sternly._]

               Hold, signorino! Was it thus
    You bade me sonnetise your Eglantine?
    You said yourself--

                                 SQUIRE

                        In sooth, that “Eglantine”
    Is sweeter.

                                JOHANNA

                Ugh!

                                CHAUCER

                     There you were false. For know
    As ocean-shells give back the mermaid’s sigh,
    The conches of a lover’s ears should hold
    Eternal murmurs of his mistress’ name.
    “Johanna” should have been thy conjure-word
    To raise all spirits; thy muses’ _nom de plume_;
    “Johanna” should have learnt thy brook to purl,
    Thy pine to sorrow, and thy lark to soar;
    And nightingales, forswearing Tereus’ name,
    Have charmed thy wakeful midnight with “Johanna.”

                                JOHANNA

    Now, pray, what says the other lady?

    As this young squire should, at one look from his--
    Should, at one look, forsake your ladyship
    For his--alas! But such is man! The bonds
    Which nature forges chain us to the flesh,
    Though angels pry the links.

    Yes, nature: ’tis not love. Had it been love,
    Would he have turned, even in his vows of truth,
    And left you with his--ah! it chokes me. Nay,
    Go, go, great marchioness, seek out your ward;
    I crave your pardon.

        the door, there pauses, and turns to Chaucer, as though he

    I take my leave.

            [_He goes to the door; Johanna rises uneasily._]

                     Yet I beseech your grace
    Will never hint to that poor youth, my friend,
    The secret I let slip.

    He thinks he’s told me who she is. Soft! _now_
    I’ll worm it out.

                               [_Aloud._]

                      Wait; if I promise never
    To hint the thing we know--you understand.

    That’s it.

               One moment, Master Geoffrey. I
    Have rallied you somewhat on your paternal
    Vintage.

                     Keep it as a pledge--
    For you are Aubrey’s friend, my Aubrey’s friend--
    As pledge that I will never, so help me Heaven,
    Reveal to him my knowledge of his secret,
    How Eglantine is his--oh, word it for me,
    For I am heartsick.

                        Trust me, honoured lady,
    You have done bravely. For did he suspect
    That I have even whispered to you how
    That nun, whose sensuous name he bade me rhyme
    In verses meant for you, that Prioress,
    Whose cloistral hand even now, lock’d in his palm,

                O mistress, hush!

                                  A cask of thy
    Diameter should keep King Richard drunk
    With laughter for a twelvemonth. Cask, I swear it,
    Thou shalt be made court-fool.

                          [_Aside to Squire._]

    Nephew, I cannot quite approve your choice.

                                JOHANNA

    Nay, keep my knot; my favour is renewed.
    I’ll sue the king myself at Canterbury
    To swaddle thee in motley.

                       [_Chaucer laughs aside._]

                               --Well, no thanks?

                                CHAUCER

    Lady, pray God I live to see that day.

                                JOHANNA

    Amen. Now, Aubrey, where’s your father? Let’s
    Make merry all together.

                                PRIORESS

                             True, my brother;
    Went he to chapel?

                                 SQUIRE

                       Ladies, I am ’shamed
    To make confession of my selfishness:
    To-day, all day, in the sweet day and night
    Of my own thoughts I have been wandering.
    I have not seen my father since this morning.
    I’ll go and seek him now.

                                CHAUCER

                              Nay, boy, remain.
    Doubtless he’s gone to chapel. I will find him
    And bring him to you here. First, though, let me
    Anticipate my fool’s prerogative
    And play the father to another’s bairns,
    This vixen girl and boy.

        [_With an affectionate smile he draws Johanna and Aubrey
                      together and kisses them._]

    St. Loy! No more?

                                JOHANNA

                      Dear fool, thou’rt not so old.
    Come now, how old?

                                CHAUCER

                       Ah, lass, my crop is rowen.
    When grey hairs creep like yarrow into clover,
    Farewell, green June! Thy growing days be over.

    Your father, when he comes, I am retired
    A moment to my room.

                    Sad? Must I wear a mask, then?
    Mistress! Mistress, masks fall away from love
    Like husks from buds in April. By love’s light
    Lovers can look through mountains to their joy
    As through these black beams I see heaven. Nay,
    Hear me! When I have won my spurs--

    I warrant him. Here--

    No, sir, I cannot.

                                ALISOUN

                       Or a marchioness?

    Ah! the fat rogue! He said your face was worth
    Unbuckling an off eye to pop it in;
    But such a pretty finch!

                             Finch! Sir, perhaps
    You are deceived in me.--Who sent you here?

                                ALISOUN

    Yon chum of that sweet spindle-shanks, my son--
    Yon rhymester, Master Geoffrey.

                                    Yes; ’twas he.

                               [_Aside._]

    Saints! is _this_ Aubrey’s father?

                                     Doubtless, sir,
    There’s no mistake. Your sister left you word--

    O villain! Aye, though I ha’ bred him! What
    Though ’tis my own son--villain! God’s teeth!

                                ALISOUN

    Your pardon, dainty dame. Before I speak
    I do not rinse my mouth in oleander.
    I am a blunt knight. Nay, I cannot sigh
    A simoon hot with sonnets like my son.
    I am a blunt knight who, on Satan’s heel,
    Hath rode it and strode it, wenched it, wived it, and knived it,
    Booted and footed ’t, till--by Venus’ shoestring,
    I be a blunt and rough but honest soldier.

                                JOHANNA

    Signore, I believe it.

                           Blunt’s the word, then;
    And here’s the blunt point. You’re deceived.

                                JOHANNA

    By whom?

                                ALISOUN

             By Aubrey.

                                JOHANNA

                        What!

                                ALISOUN

                              Aye, by my smiling son
    Wi’ the pretty curls. Where is he now?

                                JOHANNA

                                           Why, he--
    He’s gone to find the friar.

                                ALISOUN

                                 Aye.

                                JOHANNA

                                      Good Heaven!
    Can he have harmed him?

                                ALISOUN

                            Who--the friar? The friar’s
    His pal--his pal; and so is Geoffrey; aye,
    And that lascivious, Latin-singing nun--

                                JOHANNA

    What! Eglantine?

                                ALISOUN

                     Yes, she; those four! Child, child,
    Wouldst not believe it, how they’ve sneaked and schemed,
    Plotted my life, aye, for my money. But
    ’Twas lust, lust egged him on. Oh God! my son!
    And ’twas a cherub ’fore this Geoffrey warped him!

                                JOHANNA

                            [_To herself._]

    They whispered here: and there she said “Dear Aubrey.”

                                ALISOUN

    And their disguises; oh, you’d not believe it!
    That devil friar plays the chimney-sweep.
    And--

                                JOHANNA

          Chimney-sweep! ’Twas he, then, sung? Oh, come;
    Help!

                                ALISOUN

          Where?

                                JOHANNA

                 They’re in the cellar.

                                ALISOUN

                                        Like enough;
    They’re plotting, plotting. God’s wounds! ’Tis a trap.
    Where be they all? Geoffrey to send me here--
    My son to leave you with the friar--Ha!
    They’re with that sly, deceptive Prioress;
    ’Tis she--

                                JOHANNA

               Why, she’s your sister.

                                ALISOUN

                         [_As if taken back._]

                                      What--my sister!
    Is _she_ the Prioress? _She_ Eglantine?

                                JOHANNA

    Yes, yes; and she, too, left upon a pretext.
    Sir Roderigo, say, what shall we do?

                                ALISOUN

    My sister--and my son!

                                JOHANNA

                               [_Calls._]

                           Aubrey!--no answer?
    Aubrey!

                                ALISOUN

            My son and sister!

                                JOHANNA

                               Oh, poor soldier!

                                ALISOUN

    Oh, monstrous brood, hatched in a vampire’s nest!
    But I will be revenged. Go to your room;
    Lock fast the door; but when I call, “A brooch,
    A brooch!” come forth and raise the house.

                                JOHANNA

                                               Why “brooch”?

                                ALISOUN

    A watchword. Quick; go! I hear footsteps. Go!

                 [_Urges her toward door, right back._]

    Blunt is the word; your presence dangers me--
    Your room. No, no, I fear not.

                                JOHANNA

                                   Poor Sir Roderick!

          [_Exit; Alisoun shuts door; voices outside, left._]

                                ALISOUN

               Na, na, na; I saw him not.

    Nor you?

                                 DOCTOR

             A knight, say you, from the Holy Land?

                                CHAUCER

    Yes, a crusader.

                                 DOCTOR

                         [_Points at Alisoun._]

                     Is that he?

                                 Ah, thank you;

              [_Starts forward, but sees he is mistaken._]

    Nay, ’tis another man.

                                 DOCTOR

                           Good even, sir.

                                ALISOUN

    Thou’rt slow.

                                 MILLER

                               [_Aside._]

                        Slow, sweet lording.

                       What?

     [_Aside to Bottlejohn, sharpening his dagger on an ale mug._]

                                ALISOUN

                   Good; go tell her that her brother

    Your pardon, sir, I trespass. By your cross
    You come--

                                ALISOUN

               From Palestine. Well met. You, friend?

                                CHAUCER

    Nay, I’m a door-mouse, sir; a doze-at-home.
    My home’s near by at Greenwich. You have friends--
    Friends at the inn?

                                ALISOUN

                        A friend, sir; a fair friend;
    By Jupiter, a sweet friend.

                                CHAUCER

                                Ah!

                                    A sister.
    She is a nun.

    What’s that to you--her name?

                                CHAUCER

                                              Ah!
    Perhaps you know her--what? ’Tis Eglantine.

                                CHAUCER

    Impossible!--Sir, pardon me; I must
    Have made some strange mistake.

                                ALISOUN

                                    Nay, friend; I guess
    ’Tis I have made the blunder.

                                            Sooth,
    I might as well stick both feet in the mire
    And wade across my blushes. We old lads
    With beards, who sees our blushes, what? So, then,
    This prioress, she is not just my sister.

                                CHAUCER

    No?

                                ALISOUN

        No.

            What then?

                       Vous savez bien, these nuns,
    When they would have a friend, they clepe him “brother.”
    Especially on holy pilgrimage
    It hath a proper sound: “My _brother_ meets me;
    My _brother_ is a knight.” You cannot blame ’em;
    ’Tis more discreet; we men must humour ’em.
    Therefore this little honeysuckle nun
    Doth take delight to call me _brother_.

    St. Madrian! It is my love-ring. She,
    My sweet nun, gave it me. She wears a brooch
    To match it, on her wrist.

                                  Put up thy chin,
    My snow-white dove. Aha, but thou art grown!
    The silver slip o’ girlhood that I kissed
    Good-by when I set out for Palestine
    Hath mellowed into golden womanhood.
    Give me thy lips.

                                PRIORESS

                      Nay, brother, nay; my vows!
    I may not kiss a man.

                                ALISOUN

                         Toot! never fear, then;
    Thou shalt not break thy vows against _my_ beard.
    What, I’m thy brother; come!

                                PRIORESS

                                 Adieu, mon frère.

                                ALISOUN

    Soft, soft, my startled fawn. You need not jump
    Because your brother is a true crusader.
    Or didst thou fancy I was cut in stone,
    With my cold gauntlets crossed above my breast,
    Like a dumb, marble knight upon a tomb?
    Art not thou glad to see me, sister?

                                PRIORESS

                                         Yes,
    Mon frère. Forgive me, I had thought--You see,
    My nephew--’tis a pretty mannered youth;
    You’re not alike, are you?

                                ALISOUN

                             [_Laughing._]

                               By Peter’s toe,
    I hope not. Saints deliver me from being
    A new-hatched chicken’s feather.

                                PRIORESS

                                     What! your son?

                                ALISOUN

    Next, thou’ll be wishing I were like that fellow
    That fetched me here--yon what’s-his-name, yon Geoffrey.

                                PRIORESS

    Why, ’tis a noble gentleman.

       [_Enter, from cellar door, Summoner, Shipman, Cook, Friar,
                     and Manciple; they look on._]

                                ALISOUN

                                 Hoho!
    Your noble gentleman! Why, harkee, sweet;
    He told me he’s betrothèd to an ale-wife.

                                PRIORESS

    He told you--when?

                                ALISOUN

                       Just now, coming from chapel.

                                PRIORESS

    Her name?

                                ALISOUN

                  [_Ruminating, winks at the Swains._]

              What was her name, now?--Alisoun,
    The Wife of Bath, they call her.

                                PRIORESS

                                     O gran Dieu!
    That _person_!

                                ALISOUN

                 Person! God wot, ’twas not so
    Your Geoffrey called her. “Alisoun,” quoth he;
    “My lily Alisoun, my fresh wild-rose,
    My cowslip in the slough of womankind,
    Bright Alisoun shall be my bride.”

                         Come, what cheer, my girl?
    Hath that churl Geoffrey wronged thee?

                                PRIORESS

                                           No, no, no!

                                ALISOUN

    Nay, if the churl hath wronged thee, by this locket--

                                PRIORESS

    Swear not by that. _He_ swore by that.

                                ALISOUN

                                         O vile!
    He swore by this--the brooch that holds my hair,
    Thy brother’s hair?

                                PRIORESS

                        But, Roderigo--

                                ALISOUN

                                        What!
    Give’t here! Or maybe thou hast promised it
    To him?

                                PRIORESS

            No, no, mon frère. Here, take it--keep it.

                                ALISOUN

    So! By this brooch--

                               [_Aside._]

                         Now, lads, learn how to woo!
    Now, by this golden brooch of Eglantine,
    And by this little, slender wrist of pearl,
    Where once it hung; and by the limpid eyes
    Of Eglantine, and by her ripe, red mouth,
    Yea, by the warm white doves which are her breasts
    And flutter at the heart of Eglantine,
    I swear I will be ever Eglantine’s
    And lacerate the foes of Eglantine.

                                PRIORESS

    Brother, such words--

                                ALISOUN

                          Call me not brother, sweet;
    A brother’s blood is lukewarm in his limbs,
    But mine for thee is lightning. Look at me!
    Was Jove a finer figure of a man
    Than me? Had Agamemnon such an arm,
    Or Hector such a leg?

    Alack, she scorns me. Stay, Venus of virgins!
    Why dost thou wimple all the lovely dawn
    Of thy young body in this veil of night?
    Why wilt thou cork thy sweetness up, and, like
    A mummy, wrapped in rose and ivory,
    Store all thy beauty till the judgment-day?
    God did not paint thee on a window-glass.
    Step down from thy cold chapel, rosy saint,
    And take thy true-knight in thine arms.

                                PRIORESS

    Ho, Chaucer!

                                ALISOUN

                     [_Struggling with a herald._]

                 Let me out!

                                CHAUCER

                             Your Majesty?

                              KING RICHARD

    When April comes, there’s not a man in England
    But thinks on thee and love. While thou art England’s
    And England Richard’s, thou art Richard’s own.

        [_As the King embraces Chaucer, Alisoun breaks away from
                             the herald._]

                                ALISOUN

    Hold up, your Majesty! The man is mine.

                              KING RICHARD

    What’s this?

                                CHAUCER

                 My liege--another blunder.

             [_Chaucer whispers aside to the Man-of-Law._]

                              KING RICHARD

                                            So?
    The blunder was not God’s in making her.

                                ALISOUN

    The man is mine.

                              KING RICHARD

                     What, Geoffrey, art thou tripped?
    Have love and April overflowed thy verse
    To fill thy veins?

                                CHAUCER

                       Your Majesty--

                               MAN-OF-LAW

                      [_Aside to John of Gaunt._]

                                      Dan Chaucer

                            Your Majesty,
    This is that fair-reputed fay, Queen Mab,
    Who, having met amid the woods of Kent,
    Hath so enamoured me, as you have said,
    With love and April, that--to speak it short--
    We are betrothed.

                              KING RICHARD

                      Betrothed!

                        Yes, that fellow there.

                          [_Nudging Chaucer._]

    Speak on, sweet chuck.

                                CHAUCER

                           “Betrothed,” your Majesty:
    ’Tis a sweet word which lovers’ law hath hallow’d,
    But which your law, King Richard, hath envenom’d.
    “No woman may be wedded but five times:”
    Thus saith the law.

                              KING RICHARD

                        What! Where?

                                 GAUNT

                         [_Laughingly aside._]

                                CHAUCER

                                               And so,
    Because this queen of wives hath scarce been knit
    Five times in wedlock, therefore--saith the law--
    Our bosoms must be sundered.

                                 MILLER

                           [_In the crowd._]

                                 God be praised!

                                CHAUCER

    But knowing, King, how nobly wit and mercy
    Are mixed in your complexion, I presume
    To ask your greatness to outleap your laws
    And grant, by special dispensation, to
    This woman--a sixth husband.

                              KING RICHARD

                                 By my fay, sir,
    You ask too much. My laws are sacred.

             [_Aside to John of Gaunt, who whispers him._]

                                          Hein?

    Dig him again there, Geoffrey.

                                   King, have grace!

    The Duke of Lancaster advises me
    There may be one exception.

                                What? What’s that?

                               [_Aloud._]

    But only one. My law is sacred.--Woman,
    I grant to thee the right to wed once more
    On one condition. Mark it; thy sixth husband
    Must be a miller.--Herald, sound the verdict.

        [_As the herald blares his trumpet, Alisoun shakes her
        fist at Chaucer, who eyes her slily; then both burst into
        laughter._]

    If any miller here desire this woman,
    Now let him claim her.

                                 MILLER

                             [_Rushes up._]

    Come now, our prodigal Ulysses! Tell us;
    What dark adventures have befallen thee since
    Thou settest forth from Priam-Bailey’s castle?
    What inland Circe witched our laureate
    To mask his Muse among this porkish rabble?

    Carte blanche, carte blanche, mon cher. I’ll be as mute
    As e’er King Alcinous i’ the Odyssey.

    Six years ago in London, when the mob
    Roared round your stirrups, Wat the Tyler laid
    His hand upon your bridle. “Sacrilege!”
    Cried the Lord Mayor, and Wat Tyler fell
    Dead.

    God save you, a mere boy, a gallant boy--
    Cried out: “Good fellows, have you lost your captain?
    I am your King, and I will be your captain.”

                        [_The pilgrims cheer._]

    Have you forgotten how they cheered? Then hark!
    Once more that “porkish rabble” you shall hear
    Make music sweeter than your laureate’s odes.

                       [_Turning to the crowd._]

    Pilgrims and friends, deep-hearted Englishmen,
    This is your King who called himself your captain.

                       My liege, my dear young liege,
    Are these the dull grunts of the swinish herd,
    Or are they singing hearts of Englishmen?
    Where is _the gentleman_, whose ermined throat
    Shall strain a nobler shout? “When Adam delved”--
    Sire, Adam’s sons are delving still, and he
    Who scorns to set his boot-heel to the spade
    Is but a bastard.

    All, all of you!--Call me your vintner still,

    Not all the saps that mount to nature’s sun
    Can match in April magic. They who drink it--
    Yes, though it be after a thousand years,
    When this our shrine, which like the Pleiades
    Now glitters, shall be bare and rasèd stone,
    And this fresh pageant mildewed history--
    Yet they who drink the vintage I will brew
    Shall wake, and see a vision, in their wine,
    Of Canterbury and our pilgrimage:
    These very faces, with the blood in them,
    Laughter and love and tang of life in them,
    These moving limbs, this rout, this majesty!
    For by that resurrection of the Muse,
    Shall you, sweet friends, re-met in timeless Spring,
    Pace on through time upon eternal lines
    And ride with Chaucer in his pilgrimage.

                                ADDENDA


1. The accompanying reproduction of the original Hymn to St. Thomas,
of which the last verse only is sung by the pilgrims in Act IV, is
authentic in words and music.

The author is sincerely indebted to Professor Kittredge, of Harvard
University, for tracing and securing, through the various courtesies of
Mr. Albert Matthews (of Boston), Mr. Frank Kidson (of Leeds), Mr. J.
E. Matthew (of S. Hampstead, London), and Mr. Wilson (of the British
Museum Library), a copy of this almost inaccessible document.

The words are taken from Vol. 13, p. 240, of Dreves’ “Collection
of Sequences and Latin Hymns.” The music is copied from the “Sarum
Antiphonal” of 1519.

In regard to the music, Mr. Wilson writes: “Each of these Antiphons
(_i.e._ each verse of the hymn) is sung once before, and once after,
each psalm. Here there are five; and at the end of each is the
catchword of the psalm. The first is ‘_Dominus regnavit_’; the second,
‘_Jubilate_,’ and so on.”

Mr. J. E. Matthew writes: “The catchword is not sufficient, in every
case, to identify the psalm, but I have indicated all the psalms having
such beginnings.[1] The lines ‘Gloria et honore coronasti,’ etc.
(part, of course, of the 8th Psalm: ‘Thou hast crowned him with glory
and honour’), form no part of the service in the ‘Sarum Antiphonal.’”

2. For valuable information and advice regarding the chronology of
the “Canterbury Tales” as affecting this play, the author also gives
sincere thanks to his friend, Mr. John S. P. Tatlock, of the University
of Michigan.

3. The following dates will reveal certain anachronisms in the text of
his play, which the writer, for dramatic purposes, has ignored:--

        Oct. 1, 1386: Chaucer was elected Knight of the Shire for
        Kent, which office he still held in April, 1387.

        Dec. 31, 1384: Wycliffe died.

        1386: John of Gaunt left England for Castile.

4. According to Chaucer scholars, the third wife of John of Gaunt was
probably a sister of Chaucer’s wife. Upon this probability, though
it could not have been a fact until after 1387, the author bases his
dramatic license of referring to Chaucer and the Duke of Lancaster as
brothers-in-law.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation.”

• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
  works.

• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you “AS-IS”, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
